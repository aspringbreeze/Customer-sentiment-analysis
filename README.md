# Customer sentiment analysis
 I used ML (Scikit-learn) to build a simple model for customer sentiment analysis. This project mainly contains the following key steps.

 1. Split the dataset into features (Customers' review) and target (sentiment) and then into training and testing sets using 'train_test_split'.

 2. Vectorize the text data using 'CountVectorizer' for future analysis.

 3. Initialize and train the SVM model using the training data.

 4. Make predictions on the testing set using the trained model.

 5. Evaluate the model's performance by calculating the accuracy score using 'accuracy_score'.
